# Grocery Shopping List App

üöÄ Welcome to the Grocery Shopping List App! üöÄ

This project is part of my Flutter learning journey, where I explored building a mobile application with Flutter and integrating it with Firebase for backend functionality. 

## üì± What I Built

This app helps users manage their grocery shopping lists with a simple and intuitive interface.

## Set Up Firebase

### Frontend
- **Add Grocery Items**: Users can enter grocery items using `TextFormField` and select categories from a dropdown menu with `DropDownButtonFormField`.
- **Display Items**: The app shows a dynamic list of grocery items using `ListView.builder`.
- **Loading States**: Utilizes `CircularProgressIndicator` to manage loading states.
- **Delete Items**: Users can delete items with swipe gestures, and an Undo Snackbar appears for accidental deletions.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented `try-catch` blocks and status codes for robust error management.

### Backend Integration
- **Firebase**: Integrated Firebase for data storage, including `POST` and `GET` operations to manage grocery items.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Add and validate grocery items.
- Display a list of grocery items with real-time updates.
- Manage loading states and display error messages.
- Swipe to delete items with an Undo option.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Framework for building the app‚Äôs frontend.
- **Firebase**: Backend service for data storage and management.
- **Dart**: Programming language used for Flutter development.
